This is a very simplified analysis that does not distinguish between different time periods or even different companies; it just looks at the relationship between the ratio and 30 day stock performance. \n",

    "Since there is a delay between the end of a fiscal quarter and the release date, this is not an attempt to measure the direct effects of a financial report on stock performance. But since the current ratio is an indicator of the actual health of a firm, for which people have beliefs about, this is actually more of an attempt to see if market beliefs line up with an unknown reality (excepting potential insider trading...). By limiting the measure to 10 trading days, we're specifically looking at the period before the report has been released.\n",
